Learning:- 
We studied Create Browser Router -> How to create basic route -> How useEffect use with or Without dependency -> We cannot call useState inside If else, for loop, inside my functions.
->We create routing configuration -> How we createBrowserRouter -> Then we learn how we can write configuratation to develop path for different element -> Then we saw how we can add error component.

This code is a React-based application that uses react-router-dom for handling routing and navigation between different components. Here's a quick breakdown of the code:

Key Elements:
AppLayout Component:

This component serves as the layout of your application, containing the Header component at the top.
Outlet is a placeholder where the child route components will be rendered. It allows the routing system to insert components like Body, About, etc., depending on the URL path.
Router Setup:

The createBrowserRouter method defines the routes for the application. The routes specified are:
/: Displays the Body component.
/about: Displays the About component.
/contact: Displays the Contact component.
/restaurants/:resId: Displays the RestaurantMenu component, with resId being a dynamic parameter (probably the restaurant ID).
The Error component will be displayed for undefined routes or errors during routing.
RouterProvider:

This wraps your routing setup and provides the router to your application.
Render Logic:
The application is mounted to the DOM by targeting the element with the ID "root".
The RouterProvider handles navigation, and the specific components will be rendered based on the defined paths.
Improvements / Notes:
Consider handling navigation between components by adding links or buttons for better user flow.
You can manage the resId parameter in the RestaurantMenu component using useParams from react-router-dom to dynamically fetch the restaurant's data based on its ID.
